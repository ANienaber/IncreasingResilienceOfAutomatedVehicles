# Increasing Resilience of Automated Vehicles

This repository contains code for simulating and analyzing the resilience of automated vehicles. The scripts are organized as follows:

- **bdd.py** – Defines binary decision diagrams (BDD) and operations on them.
- **exec.py** – Executes the proposed strategy for a given Text file of Formulae.
- **formula_generator.py** – Automatically generates formulas with given parameters.
- **model.py** – Script that implements the algorithm.
- **parser.py** – Parses strings so they can be build into BDDS.
- **plotter.py** – Visualizes simulation outputs.
- **experimentation/** – Contains scripts for specific experiments and test scenarios.
- **bdd_example/** – Example BDDs.
- **out/** – Stores output data, plots, and results from simulations.
